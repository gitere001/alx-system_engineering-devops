Welcome to the Postmortems Directory! This repository contains a collection of reports detailing incidents that occurred within our system, along with their analyses, resolutions, and measures taken to prevent future recurrences.

## What Are Postmortems?
Postmortems, also known as incident reviews or retrospectives, are detailed examinations conducted after an incident or outage within a system or service. These reports serve several crucial purposes:

- Understanding Incidents: Postmortems provide insights into what went wrong during an incident, including its duration, impact on users, and the root cause.

- Resolving Issues: By identifying the root cause of an incident, teams can implement effective resolutions to restore system functionality and mitigate the impact on users.

- Continuous Improvement: Postmortems facilitate a culture of learning and improvement within the organization. They help teams identify areas for enhancement in systems, processes, and procedures, leading to increased reliability and efficiency over time.
